#### Landing Page Hero Enhancement - Spread Betting

### evidence
Some of the key information on the page is hidden below the fold, therefore users who do not scroll will miss this information

### hypothesis
making use of the space on the right hand side of the hero image will shorten and put all the selling points in front of the user without having to scroll.  
Adding an email capture form will make the call to action more prominent and will lead to more people completing live account application form

### targeting
see TestPlan

### devices
- desktop
- table
- mobile

### browsers
- chrome 45+
- firefox 45+
- IE10+


### notes
- completed using javascript (no frameworks).     
- pretty straight forward. The most complicated bit, I guess it would have to be the first row; which I ended up cloning it for mobile, in order to get the background color right. (Cloned, then set original div display to none and appended clone to new location for mobile)
